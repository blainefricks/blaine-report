        <h3>This movie is a prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 The Thing, not a remake.  If you haven't seen the original, then go watch it now! Although it may be dated, its still good, even better than The Thing (2011).</h3>
        <p>The prequel does a good job shedding light on the mystery surrounding the events that take place at the Norwegian research base as seen in the 1982 movie. The opening and ending were both strong, especially the scene leading up to the original (plays during end credits), very well done. The middle drew too much on the originality of the 1982's thrills and made them look cliche. I wasn't too fond of the use of CGI either, the technology just isn't there yet. The thing wasn't as mysterious this time around and was too human looking. Overall it was great if you enjoyed The Thing (1982).</p>
